The only place I post my WIP mods, _**please delete once you've tested the mod**_

I say this is because if you transmog an beta mod gear, you might lose the original transmogged item once the offical Nexus version is posted.

Testing purposes only, Again, Please do not play with these for long term, the Nexus version ***will delete*** the beta gear from the .pak. 

Please look on the Release Link on the Right Hand Side [or here](https://github.com/pommelstrike/Celery_Afterthought/releases)
